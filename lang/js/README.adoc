= XTDB JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

This is _very_ early days as yet.
Particularly, it's currently missing tests and user documentation.

== Get started

1. It's published to NPM as `@xtdb/xtdb` - to add it to a project:
   * `npm install '@xtdb/xtdb'`
   * `yarn add '@xtdb/xtdb'`
2. `import Xtdb, { q, tx, ex } from '@xtdb/xtdb'`
3. `const xtdb = new Xtdb('http://localhost:3000')`
4. Transactions:
+
[source,js]
----
const txKey = await xtdb.submitTx([
  tx.putDocs('myTable',
    {"xt/id": 1, ...},
    {"xt/id": 2, ...}),

  ...
])
----
5. Queries:
+
[source,js]
----
const res = await node.query([
  q.from('myTable'),
  q.aggregate({rc: ex.call("rowCount")})
])
----

== Publishing

1. Get yourself an account on https://www.npmjs.com/
2. Ask @jarohen for an invite to the `@xtdb` org.
3. `yarn publish --no-git-tag-version`.
   We're currently using version `0.0.0-YYYY.M.D.n` (closest approximation to a Maven snapshot).
