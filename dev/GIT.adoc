= Git practices in XTDB

:reviewed: 2024-10-29

A rough guide of how we tend to use Git, in practice.
Obviously use discretion when applying these - they're guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
This is a living document - please feel free to start discussions/raise PRs.

We loosely follow a https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/['git flow'] model.
Differences:

* We develop on the `main` branch, rather than `develop`.
* When we find bugs on a previous release that require patch releases, we create a branch from main named (for example) `1.10.x`.

Other conventions:

* https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html[Ship/Show/Ask]
+
Developers are trusted to recognise which of these paths apply to any given change.
+
Simple, uncontroversial changes (typos, say, or other non-code changes) can go straight to `main`, but be aware of the curse of the 'simple change'.
Feel free to err on the side of caution if need be.

** PRs (within reason) should be atomic - the 'minimum viable merge'.
   If you've got to a point where your change would add value to an XTDB user, it can be a PR.
** On the other side, don't include unrelated bugfixes in a larger PR, because we may want to merge those independently of the rest of the PR.
** Where reasonable, try to make the distinction between changes that preserve XTDB's behaviour (e.g. refactorings/restructurings) and changes that advance XTDB - it's much easier to review a change knowing that it's supposed to behave exactly the same as it did before.

* **Optimise your commits/PRs for later reading**
+
Future developers looking back at commits will likely not care about the exact trials and tribulations/learning path you went through to fix a bug/write a feature (though no doubt it felt like an arduous journey at the time).
Consider *why* developers might need to go back and look at commit history and how you'd explain your change to those developers, and organise your commits accordingly - it's probably not "on Tuesday I did this, then on Wednesday I did this"!
Remember, 'future developers' will likely include 'future you' :wink:
+
Commits should be atomic units of change, a transition from a valid state to another valid state - feel free to liberally re-write history on your branch to achieve this.
If a commit doesn't make sense/work independently without another commit, it's probably a single commit.
Likewise, if it's two distinct changes, it's two distinct commits.
+
(FWIW, I tend to make a load of throwaway 'checkpoint' commits - then, when I get to an intermediate working milestone, I'll squash down the checkpoint commits to one atomic commit.
I find this works well, but each to their own.)

* **Prefer a linear history**
+
This is related to the previous point, because it's much easier to reason about/bisect changes if they're linear. It means:

** Prefer rebasing feature branches on `main` to pull in changes from elsewhere over merging `main` into the feature branch.
** When you merge your feature branch back into main, there are a few patterns, depending on the size of the change:
*** Github's 'squash and merge PR' is a reasonable default
*** If it's a single commit, it can go straight onto main (once reviewed)
*** If you want to keep the original commits visible (for git blame purposes, say), `git switch main && git merge --no-ff <branch>` clearly marks out a block of work, preserves your commits, and keeps the history linear.

* **The issue/PR assignee is responsible for progression**
+

There's two parts to this: firstly, if it's you, it's up to you to chase whoever needs chasing, unblock what needs unblocking, replying to whoever needs replying to, figuring out what needs to be done, etc, so that it's complete **end-to-end**.
This can obviously include delegating out if need be - you don't have to _do_ it all yourself - just make sure you're coordinating it.

You are also responsible for ensuring that the card (and more generally, the board) reflects the current state of your work - particularly:

* Please update the card description to be an accurate summary of what you're working towards, if that changes.
  Feel free to add journaling comments, obviously, but updating the card description ensures that a reader can easily understand the current state without having to 'reduce over' the comments.
* Please ensure the status is correct - if it's awaiting review, please ensure the reviewer is added to the PR; if it needs a re-review, please press the re-review button so that the reviewer is notified.

This may sound pedantic, but these small things really do make overall project maintenance significantly simpler üôè.

With PRs, the assignee is considered to have the 'lock' on the branch.

Secondly, though (and probably more commonly) - if it's you and it shouldn't be, or it's not you and it should be, update it (even if that means no assignee) :smile:

* **Use a fork of https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb**
+
This means you're responsible for cleaning up your branches rather than have them cluttering up the main repo and annoying me :wink:
