title: What is XTQL?
---

XTDB is queryable using two query languages: **SQL** and **XTQL**.

XTQL is our new, data-oriented, composable query language, inspired by the strong theoretical bases of both **Datalog** and **relational algebra**.
These two combine to create a joyful, productive, interactive development experience, with the ability to build queries iteratively, testing and debugging smaller parts in isolation.

XTQL is also designed to be highly amenable to dynamic query generation - we believe that our industry has spent more than enough time trying to generate SQL strings (not to mention the concomitant https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection[security vulnerabilities^]).

It has **JSON** footnote:[in active development, arriving shortly] and **EDN** flavours, with client libraries to come in Java/Kotlin, JavaScript, and many more.

== 'Operators' and 'relations'

XTQL is built up of small, composable 'operators', which combine together using 'pipelines' into larger queries.

* 'Source' operators (e.g. 'read from a table') each yield a 'relation' - an unordered bag of rowsfootnote:[rows ... which themselves are otherwise known as 'maps', 'structs', 'records' or 'dictionaries' depending on your persuasion ðŸ˜„].
* 'Tail' operators (e.g. 'filter a relation', 'calculate extra fields') transform a relation into another relation.

From these simple operators, we can build arbitrarily complex queries.

Our first operator is `from`:

=== `from`

The `from` operator allows us to read from an XTDB table.
In this first example, we're reading the first-name and last-name fields from the `users` table - i.e. `SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users`:

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,json]
----
{
  "from": "users",
  "bind": [ "first_name", "last_name" ]
}
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
[source,clojure]
----
(from :users [first-name last-name])
----
====

In the `from` operator, we can also rename columns, and filter rows based on field values.
Another source operator is `rel`, which allows you to specify an inline relation.

You can check out the link:/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_source_operators[source operators reference] for more details.

=== Pipelines

We can then transform the rows in a table using tail operators, which we pass in an operator 'pipeline'.
Pipelines consist of a single source operator, and then arbitrarily many tail operators.

Here, we demonstrate `SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users ORDER BY last_name, first_name LIMIT 10`, introducing the 'order by' and 'limit' operators:

In JSON, we wrap the operators in an array to denote a pipeline:

[source,json]
----
[
  { "from": "users", "bind": [ "first_name", "last_name" ] },
  { "order_by" : [ "last_name", "first_name" ]},
  { "limit": 10 },
]
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
In Clojure, we use `+->+` to denote a pipeline - in a similar vein to the threading macro in Clojure 'core' footnote:[although XTQL's `+->+` isn't technically macro-expanded - it's just data.], we take one source operator and then pass it through a series of transformations.

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (from :users [first-name last-name])
    (order-by last-name first-name)
    (limit 10))
----
====

By building queries using pipelines, we are now free to build these up incrementally, trivially re-use parts of pipelines in different queries, or temporarily disable some operators to test parts of the pipeline in isolation.

Other tail operators include `where` (to filter rows), `return` (to specify the columns to output), `with` (to add additional columns based on the existing ones), and `aggregate` (grouping rows - counts, sums, etc).
For a full list, see the link:/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_tail_operators[tail operators reference].

[#unify]
=== Multiple tables - introducing `unify`

Joining multiple tables in XTQL is achieved using Datalog-based 'unification'.

We introduce the `unify` source operator, which takes an unordered bag of input relations and joins them together using 'unification constraints' (similar to join conditions).

Each input relation (e.g. `from`) defines a set of 'logic variables' in its bindings.
If a logic variable appears more than once within a single unify clause, the results are constrained such that the logic variable has the same value everywhere itâ€™s used.
This has the effect of imposing 'join conditions' over the inputs.

For example, imagine 'for each order, get me the customer name, order-id and order value'

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.customer_name, o.xt$id AS order_id, o.order_value
FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON (o.customer_id = c.xt$id)
----

In XTQL, we specify the join condition by re-using a logic variable (`customer_id`), constraining the two input tables to have the same value for `o.customer_id` and `c.xt$id` (customer table primary key):

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "unify": [
      // bind `customer_id` to the `xt$id` of the `customers` table
      { "from": "customers", "bind": [ { "xt$id": "customer_id" }, "customer_name" ] },

      // also bind `customer_id` to the `customer_id` of the `orders` table
      { "from": "orders", "bind": [ { "xt$id": "order_id" }, "customer_id", "order_value" ] }
    ]
  },

  { "return": [ "customer_name", "order_id", "order_value" ]}
]
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,clojure]
----
(-> (unify (from :customers [{:xt/id customer-id} customer-name])
           (from :orders [{:xt/id order-id} customer-id order-value]))
    (return customer-name order-id order-value))
----
====

The `unify` operator accepts 'unify clauses' - e.g. `from`, `where`, `with`, `join`, `left-join` - a full list of which can be found in the link:/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify_clauses[unify clause reference guide].

== For more information

Congratulations - this is the majority of the theory behind XTQL!
You now understand the fundamentals behind how to construct XTQL queries from its simple building blocks - from here, it's much more about incrementally learning what each individual operator does, and what it looks like in your client language.

You can:

We're very much in **listening mode** right now - as a keen early adopter, we'd love to hear your first impressions, thoughts and opinions on where we're headed with XTQL.
