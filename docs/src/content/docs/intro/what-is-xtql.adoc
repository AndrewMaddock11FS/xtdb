title: What is XTQL?
---

XTDB is queryable using two query languages: **SQL** and **XTQL**.

XTQL is our new, data-oriented, composable query language, inspired by the strong theoretical bases of both **Datalog** and **relational algebra**.
These two combine to create a joyful, productive, interactive development experience, with the ability to build queries iteratively, testing and debugging smaller parts in isolation.

* It is designed to be highly amenable to dynamic query generation - we believe that our industry has spent more than enough time trying to generate SQL strings (not to mention the concomitant https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection[security vulnerabilities^]).
* It has **JSON** and **EDN** flavours, with client libraries to come in Java/Kotlin, JavaScript, and many more.
* It can be used for both link:#operators_and_relations[queries] and link:#dml[transactions].

Let's start with XTQL queries:

[#operators_and_relations]
== 'Operators' and 'relations'

XTQL is built up of small, composable 'operators', which combine together using 'pipelines' into larger queries.

* 'Source' operators (e.g. 'read from a table') each yield a 'relation' - an unordered bag of rowsfootnote:[rows ... which themselves are otherwise known as 'maps', 'structs', 'records' or 'dictionaries' depending on your persuasion ðŸ˜„].
* 'Tail' operators (e.g. 'filter a relation', 'calculate extra fields') transform a relation into another relation.

From these simple operators, we can build arbitrarily complex queries.

Our first operator is `from`:

=== `from`

The `from` operator allows us to read from an XTDB table.
In this first example, we're reading the first-name and last-name fields from the `users` table - i.e. `SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users`:

}
----

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
[source,clojure]
----
(from :users [first-name last-name])
----
====

It's in the `from` operator that we specify the temporal filter for the table.
By default, this shows the table at the current time, but it can be overridden:

* to view the table at another point in time
* to view the changes to the table within a given range
* to view the entire history of the table

  "from": "users",
  "bind": [ "first_name", "last_name" ],

  // at another point in time
  "forValidTime": { "at": { "@type": "xt:date", "@value": "2023-01-01" } },

  // within a given range
  "forValidTime": { "in": [ { "@type": "xt:date", "@value": "2023-01-01" },
                            { "@type": "xt:date", "@value": "2024-01-01" } ] },
  "forValidTime": { "from": { "@type": "xt:date", "@value": "2023-01-01" } },
  "forValidTime": { "to": { "@type": "xt:date", "@value": "2024-01-01" } },

  // for all time
  "forValidTime": "allTime",

  // and all of the above "forSystemTime" too.
}

              ;; at another point in time

              ;; within a given range
              :for-valid-time (in #inst "2023-01-01", #inst "2024-01-01")
              :for-valid-time (from #inst "2023-01-01")
              :for-valid-time (to #inst "2024-01-01")

              ;; for all time
              :for-valid-time :all-time

              ;; and all of the above :for-system-time too.
              })

In the `from` operator, we can also rename columns, and filter rows based on field values.
Another source operator is `rel`, which allows you to specify an inline relation.

You can check out the link:/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_source_operators[source operators reference] for more details.

=== Pipelines

We can then transform the rows in a table using tail operators, which we pass in an operator 'pipeline'.
Pipelines consist of a single source operator, and then arbitrarily many tail operators.

Here, we demonstrate `SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users ORDER BY last_name, first_name LIMIT 10`, introducing the 'order by' and 'limit' operators:

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
In JSON, we wrap the operators in an array to denote a pipeline:

[source,json]
----
[
  { "from": "users", "bind": [ "first_name", "last_name" ] },
  { "orderBy" : [ "last_name", "first_name" ]},
  { "limit": 10 },
]
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
In Clojure, we use `+->+` to denote a pipeline - in a similar vein to the threading macro in Clojure 'core' footnote:[although XTQL's `+->+` isn't technically macro-expanded - it's just data.], we take one source operator and then pass it through a series of transformations.

[source,clojure]
----
(-> (from :users [first-name last-name])
    (order-by last-name first-name)
    (limit 10))
----
====

By building queries using pipelines, we are now free to build these up incrementally, trivially re-use parts of pipelines in different queries, or temporarily disable some operators to test parts of the pipeline in isolation.

Other tail operators include `where` (to filter rows), `return` (to specify the columns to output), `with` (to add additional columns based on the existing ones), and `aggregate` (grouping rows - counts, sums, etc).
For a full list, see the link:/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_tail_operators[tail operators reference].

[#unify]
=== Multiple tables - introducing `unify`

Joining multiple tables in XTQL is achieved using Datalog-based 'unification'.

We introduce the `unify` source operator, which takes an unordered bag of input relations and joins them together using 'unification constraints' (similar to join conditions).

Each input relation (e.g. `from`) defines a set of 'logic variables' in its bindings.
If a logic variable appears more than once within a single unify clause, the results are constrained such that the logic variable has the same value everywhere itâ€™s used.
This has the effect of imposing 'join conditions' over the inputs.

For example, imagine 'for each order, get me the customer name, order-id and order value'

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.customer_name, o.xt$id AS order_id, o.order_value
FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON (o.customer_id = c.xt$id)
----

In XTQL, we specify the join condition by re-using a logic variable (`customer_id`), constraining the two input tables to have the same value for `o.customer_id` and `c.xt$id` (customer table primary key):

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "unify": [
      // bind `customer_id` to the `xt$id` of the `customers` table
      { "from": "customers", "bind": [ { "xt$id": "customer_id" }, "customer_name" ] },

      // also bind `customer_id` to the `customer_id` of the `orders` table
      { "from": "orders", "bind": [ { "xt$id": "order_id" }, "customer_id", "order_value" ] }
    ]
  },

  { "return": [ "customer_name", "order_id", "order_value" ]}
]
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
[source,clojure]
----
(-> (unify (from :customers [{:xt/id customer-id} customer-name])
           (from :orders [{:xt/id order-id} customer-id order-value]))
    (return customer-name order-id order-value))
----
====

The `unify` operator accepts 'unify clauses' - e.g. `from`, `where`, `with`, `join`, `left-join` - a full list of which can be found in the link:/reference/main/xtql/queries.html#_unify_clauses[unify clause reference guide].

[#dml]
== XTQL transactions - DML

XTQL can also be used in XTDB transactions to insert, update, delete and erase documents based on an XTQL query.
It uses the same query language as above, with a small wrapper for each of the operations.

These queries are evaluated on XTDB's single writer thread, so are guaranteed the strongest level of consistency.

=== `insert`

We can submit link:/reference/main/xtql/txs#_insert_into['insert' operations] to XTDB - these evaluate a query, and insert every result into the given table.

e.g. `INSERT INTO users2 SELECT xt$id, first_name AS given_name, last_name AS family_name FROM users`:

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,json]
----
{
  "insert": "users2",
  "query": {
    "from": "users",
    "bind": [ "xt$id", {"first_name": "given_name"}, {"last_name": "family_name"}]
  }
}
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
[source,clojure]
----
[:insert-into :users2
 '(from :users [xt/id {:first-name given-name, :last-name family-name}
                xt/valid-from xt/valid-to])]
----
====

=== `update`

link:/reference/main/xtql/txs#_update_table[Update operations] find rows, and specify which fields to update.

Here, we're incrementing a 'version' attribute - `UPDATE docs SET version = version + 1 WHERE xt$id = ?`

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,json]
----
{
  "update": "documents",
  "bind": [ { "xt$id": "$doc_id", "version": "v" }],
  "set": { "version": { "@call": "+", "@args": [ "v", 1 ] } }
}

// separately, we pass the following as the arguments to the query:
{ "doc_id": "my-doc-id" }
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
[source,clojure]
----
[:update {:table :documents
          :bind [{:xt/id $doc-id, :version v}]
          :set {:version (+ v 1)}}

 ;; specifying a value for the parameter with args
 {:doc-id "doc-id"}]
----
====

=== `delete`

link:/reference/main/xtql/txs#_delete_from[Delete operations] work like 'update' operations, but without the `set` clause.

Here, we delete all the comments for a given post-id - `DELETE FROM comments WHERE post_id = ?`

.JSON
[%collapsible%open]
====
[source,json]
----
{
  "delete": "comments",
  "bind": [ { "post_id": "$post_id" }]
}

// separately, we pass the following as the arguments to the query:
{ "post_id": "my-post-id" }
----
====

.Clojure
[%collapsible]
====
[source,clojure]
----
[:delete {:from :posts, :bind [{:post-id $post-id}]}

 ;; specifying a value for the parameter with args
 {:post-id "post-id"}]
----
====

Congratulations - this is the majority of the theory behind XTQL!
You now understand the fundamentals behind how to construct XTQL queries from its simple building blocks - from here, it's much more about incrementally learning what each individual operator does, and what it looks like in your client language.

You can:

* check out the reference guides for XTQL link:/reference/main/xtql/queries[queries] and link:/reference/main/xtql/txs[transactions].

We're very much in **listening mode** right now - as a keen early adopter, we'd love to hear your first impressions, thoughts and opinions on where we're headed with XTQL.
