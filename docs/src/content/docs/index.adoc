== XTDB in a nutshell

XTDB is a **bitemporal** and **dynamic** **relational** database for **regulated data**.

XTDB v2 has been designed with an HTTP API front and center, with the intention of gaining the widest possible audience. While we work on the finer details of the JSON-oriented APIs and a variety of client libraries in support of this mission, we currently only offer stable usage of v2 via Clojure.

== Key Features

- **Cloud native:** modern columnar architecture built around https://arrow.apache.org/[Apache Arrow].
- **Bitemporal:** all data is accurately versioned as updates are made (system time), and all data exists within a universal domain timeline for representing 'validity'/'effectivity' (valid time).
- **Dynamic:** no upfront schema needs to be specified before records can be inserted. Complex and nested data is automatically represented using Apache Arrow types.
- **Relational:** the full spectrum of traditional SQL database capabilities is available - including joins, transactions, bag/multiset semantics, three-valued logic, multiple N-ary relations etc.
- **SQL:** immediate accessibility for a mainstream audience and an eye to the future with preliminary Flight SQL driver support.
- **XTQL:** programmer-friendly API for complex relational querying that overcomes many of SQLâ€™s compositional challenges.

### âž¡ Quick start
Get up and running quickly with an interactive introduction to XTDB.

### âž¡ Build a sample app
Sample apps show XTDB features and capabilities in an application context.

Our link:/en/install/auto/[Installation Guide] has full, step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring XTDB, and adding a client driver to your project.

To start querying XTDB from your application code, choose your language:

- Java
- Clojure
- Curl (HTTP)
////

To start querying XTDB from your application code, you can currently use the Clojure client library or the HTTP interfaces directly, for both SQL and XTQL.
The HTTP SQL interface is stateless. An experimental pgwire-server is also available to connect from any Postgres client driver if you wish to use SQL.

== What is in the documentation?

These three main sections can help you learn XTDB:

- Cookbook - This section provides solutions to common problems that users face querying an XTDB database. Most solutions provide cut-and-paste queries that need very little modification.
- API Reference - Complete reference materials for the APIs you can use to interact with XTDB.
