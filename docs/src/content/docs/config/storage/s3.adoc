title: S3
---

S3 can be used as a shared object-store for XTDB's remote storage module.

[NOTE]
====
The S3 module uses an SNS topic and SQS queues to maintain a local copy of the file listings on S3, saving on expensive/lengthy operations to list objects on S3.

If not using the link:#_cloudformation_stack[CloudFormation stack], ensure that you have a similar setup with the SNS topic setup to receive notifications from your bucket, and that XTDB has all the relevant permissions it needs with S3, SNS, and SQS.
====

== Setup

First, ensure the `com.xtdb/xtdb-s3` Maven dependency is added to your XTDB node.

=== Infrastructure

[NOTE]
.CloudFormation stack
====
We provide a https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb/blob/2.x/modules/s3/cloudformation/s3-stack.yml[parameterized CloudFormation stack] to help set up everything that you need.

The stack accepts the (globally unique) name of an S3 bucket as an input - this will be created, and referenced in associated resources - and outputs the SNS topic ARN, to be used in your XTDB configuration.
====

To use S3 as the object store, the following infrastructure is required:

. An **S3 bucket**.
. An **SNS topic** to receive notifications from the S3 bucket around object creation/deletion.
. The bucket should be granted permissions to publish to the SNS topic:
+
[source,yaml]

  Type: AWS::SNS::TopicPolicy
  Properties:
    PolicyDocument:
      Statement:

. IAM policies which grant XTDB permission to:
  * the S3 bucket:

    - 's3:GetObject'
    - 's3:PutObject'
    - 's3:DeleteObject'

  * subscribe to the SNS topic:

[source,yaml]

Statement:
- Effect: Allow
  Action:
    - 'sns:Subscribe'
    - 'sns:Unsubscribe'
  Resource:
    - !Ref SNSTopic

  * create and operate on SQS queues:
+
[source,yaml]
----
Statement:
- Effect: Allow
  Action:
    - 'sqs:CreateQueue'
    - 'sqs:GetQueueUrl'
    - 'sqs:GetQueueAttributes'
    - 'sqs:DeleteQueue'
    - 'sqs:DeleteMessage'
    - 'sqs:ReceiveMessage'
    - 'sqs:SetQueueAttributes'
  Resource:
    - '*'

=== Authentication

Authentication is done via the AWS SDK, using the default AWS credential provider chain.
See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-chain.html[AWS documentation] for setup instructions.

== Configuration

To use the S3 module, include the following in your node configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
storage: !Remote
  objectStore: !S3
    # -- required

    # The name of the S3 bucket to use for the object store
    bucket: "my-s3-bucket"

    # The ARN of the SNS topic which is collecting notifications from the S3 bucket.
    snsTopicArn: "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:my-sns-topic"

    # -- optional
    # A file path to prefix all of your files with
    # - for example, if "foo" is provided, all XTDB files will be located under a "foo" sub-directory
    # prefix: my-xtdb-node

  localDiskCache: /var/cache/xtdb/object-store
----

=== Examples

For examples on how to enable/configure the S3 module as part of your node, for each client library, see the individual SDK documentation:
