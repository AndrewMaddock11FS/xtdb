== Transaction operations

=== `INSERT`

Inserts documents into a table.

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO <table> (<column_name> [ , ... ]) <documents>

documents :: VALUES (<value> [ , ... ]) [ , ... ]
           | <select_query>
----

* Documents must contain an `_id` column.
* By default, the document will be inserted for valid-time between now and end-of-time.
  This can be overridden by including `_valid_from` and/or `_valid_to` columns in the document.
* If the document already exists, 'insert' currently behaves like an upsert - it will overwrite the existing document for the valid-time range specified (or now -> end-of-time if not provided).


=== `UPDATE`

Updates documents in a table, optionally for a period of valid-time.

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE <table>
  [ <for_valid_time> ]
  SET <column> = <value> [ , ... ]
  [ WHERE <predicate> ]

for_valid_time :: FOR PORTION OF VALID_TIME FROM <date_time> TO <date_time>
                | FOR ALL VALID_TIME | FOR VALID_TIME ALL
----

* If `for_valid_time` is not provided, the effective valid-time range of the update depends on the `defaultAllValidTime` transaction argument.
  If it is true, the update will be effective for all valid time (including in the past); otherwise it will be effective from now to the end of time.
  (SQL:2011 specifies that updates without this clause should be effective for all valid time; the flag is an XTDB addition.)
* The `_id` column cannot be updated - instead, users should delete this document and re-insert a new one.
* The valid-time columns cannot be updated outside of the `for_valid_time` clause (i.e. not in the `SET` clause).


=== `DELETE`

Deletes documents from a table, optionally for a period of valid-time.

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM <table>
  [ <for_valid_time> ]
  [ WHERE <predicate> ]

for_valid_time :: FOR PORTION OF VALID_TIME FROM <date_time> TO <date_time>
                | FOR ALL VALID_TIME
----

* If `for_valid_time` is not provided, the effective valid-time range of the delete depends on the `defaultAllValidTime` transaction argument.
  If it is true, the delete will be effective for all valid time (including in the past); otherwise it will be effective from now to the end of time.
  (SQL:2011 specifies that deletes without this clause should be effective for all valid time; the flag is an XTDB addition.)

=== `ERASE`

Irrevocably erases documents from a table, for all valid-time, for all system-time.

While XTDB is immutable, in some cases it is legally necessary to irretrievably delete data (e.g. for a GDPR request).
This operation removes data such that even queries as of a previous system-time no longer return the erased data.

[source,sql]
----
ERASE FROM <table> [ WHERE <predicate> ]
----

=== `ASSERT`

Rolls back the transaction if the provided predicate is false.

This is used to enforce constraints on the data in a concurrent environment, such as ensuring that a document with a given ID does not already exist.

[source,sql]
----
ASSERT <predicate>
----

* We check to see whether the email address already exists in the database - if not, we can insert the new user.
+
[source,sql]
----
ASSERT NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE email = 'james@example.com')

INSERT INTO users (_id, name, email) VALUES ('james', 'James', 'james@example.com')
----
