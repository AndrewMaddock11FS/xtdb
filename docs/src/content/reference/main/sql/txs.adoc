= SQL Transactions

SQL transactions are submitted through `xtdb.api/submit-tx`.

* `(xt/submit-tx <node> <tx-ops> <opts>?)`: returns the transaction key of the submitted transaction.
** `tx-ops`: vector of link:#tx-ops[transaction operations].
** `opts` (map):
*** `:default-all-valid-time?` (boolean, default false): whether to default to all valid time if not explicitly specified in the query.
* `(xt/submit-tx& <node> <tx-ops> <opts>?)`: returns a `CompletableFuture` of the transaction key.

== Transaction operations

SQL transaction operations are of the form `(xt/sql-op "<sql query>")`.

e.g.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[xtdb.api :as xt])

(xt/submit-tx node [(xt/sql-op "INSERT INTO users (xt$id, name) VALUES ('jms', 'James')")

                    ;; with args - pass multiple vectors if required.
                    ;; use `xt/with-op-arg-rows` if you don't want a variadic function
                    ;; (i.e. you already have a vector of vectors).
                    (-> (xt/sql-op "INSERT INTO users (xt$id, name) VALUES (?, ?)")
                        (xt/with-op-args ["jms" "James"]
                                         ["jdt", "Jeremy"]))])

[NOTE]
====
There is a table and column name mapping between SQL and Datalog: documents inserted with Datalog have their hyphens translated to underscores, and their namespace segments converted to `$` symbols, as hyphens, periods and slashes are not valid symbols in SQL identifiers.

For example, `:foo.bar/baz-quux` in Datalog is referenced in SQL as `foo$bar$baz_quux`.

The built-in XTDB columns `:xt/id`, `:xt/valid-from`, `:xt/valid-to` etc are referenced in SQL as `xt$id`, `xt$valid_from` and `xt$valid_to` respectively.

This mapping is reversed when querying SQL documents from Datalog.

=== `INSERT`

Inserts documents into a table.

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO <table> (<column_name> [ , ... ]) <documents>

documents :: VALUES (<value> [ , ... ]) [ , ... ]
           | <select_query>
----

* Documents must contain an `xt$id` column.
* By default, the document will be inserted for valid-time between now and end-of-time.
  This can be overridden by including `xt$valid_from` and/or `xt$valid_to` columns in the document.
* If the document already exists, 'insert' currently behaves like an upsert - it will overwrite the existing document for the valid-time range specified (or now -> end-of-time if not provided).


=== `UPDATE`

Updates documents in a table, optionally for a period of valid-time.

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE <table>
  [ <for_valid_time> ]
  SET <column> = <value> [ , ... ]
  [ WHERE <predicate> ]

for_valid_time :: FOR PORTION OF VALID_TIME FROM <date_time> TO <date_time>
                | FOR ALL VALID_TIME
----

* If `for_valid_time` is not provided, the effective valid-time range of the update depends on the `:default-all-valid-time?` transaction argument.
  If it is true, the update will be effective for all valid time (including in the past); otherwise it will be effective from now to the end of time.
  (SQL:2011 specifies that updates without this clause should be effective for all valid time; the flag is an XTDB addition.)
* The `xt$id` column cannot be updated - instead, users should delete this document and re-insert a new one.
* The valid-time columns cannot be updated outside of the `for_valid_time` clause (i.e. not in the `SET` clause).


=== `DELETE`

Deletes documents from a table, optionally for a period of valid-time.

[source,sql]
----
DELETE FROM <table>
  [ <for_valid_time> ]
  [ WHERE <predicate> ]

for_valid_time :: FOR PORTION OF VALID_TIME FROM <date_time> TO <date_time>
                | FOR ALL VALID_TIME
----

* If `for_valid_time` is not provided, the effective valid-time range of the delete depends on the `:default-all-valid-time?` transaction argument.
  If it is true, the delete will be effective for all valid time (including in the past); otherwise it will be effective from now to the end of time.
  (SQL:2011 specifies that deletes without this clause should be effective for all valid time; the flag is an XTDB addition.)

=== `ERASE`

Irrevocably erases documents from a table, for all valid-time, for all system-time.

While XTDB is immutable, in some cases it is legally necessary to irretrievably delete data (e.g. for a GDPR request).
This operation removes data such that even queries as of a previous system-time no longer return the erased data.

[source,sql]
----
ERASE FROM <table> [ WHERE <predicate> ]
