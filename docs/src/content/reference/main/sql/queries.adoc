= SQL Queries

SQL queries are submitted through `xtdb.api/q`:

* `(xt/q <node> <query> <opts>?)` returns the query results as a vector of maps.
** `opts`: map of query options
*** `:args`: vector of query arguments
*** `:basis`, `:basis-timeout`, `:default-all-valid-time?`: see link:../xtql/queries#basis[XTQL]
    By default, `:default-all-valid-time?` is false, unlike the SQL:2011 specification - to maintain SQL spec compatibility, specify `:default-all-valid-time? true`.
* `(xt/q& <node> <query> <opts>?)`: returns a `CompletableFuture` of the query results.

For example:

[source,clojure]
----
(xt/q node "SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name FROM users u WHERE xt$id = ?"
      {:args ["James"], :default-all-valid-time? true})

Fuller SQL reference documentation will follow shortly.

For now, the following is a subset of what's currently possible in XTDB SQL:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT <value> [ [ AS ] <column_name> ] [ , ... ]
FROM <relation> [ [ AS ] <table_alias> [ (<column_name> [, ...] ) ]] [ , ... ]
     [ <join_clause>+ ]
[ WHERE <predicate> ]
[ GROUP BY <value> [ , ... ] ]
[ ORDER BY <value> [ (ASC | DESC) ] [ , ... ] ]
[ LIMIT <number> ]
[ OFFSET <number> ]

relation :: <table_name> [ <for_system_time> ] [ <for_valid_time> ]
          | ( <sub_query> )
          | ( VALUES (<column_name> [ , ... ]) )

for_system_time :: FOR SYSTEM_TIME <temporal_range> | FOR ALL SYSTEM_TIME
for_valid_time :: FOR VALID_TIME <temporal_range> | FOR ALL VALID_TIME
temporal_range :: AS OF <date_time>
                | FROM <date_time> TO <date_time> -- start inclusive, end exclusive
                | BETWEEN <date_time> AND <date_time> -- start inclusive, end inclusive

join_clause :: [ join_type ] JOIN <relation> <join_condition> [ ... ]
join_type :: INNER | LEFT [ OUTER ] | RIGHT [ OUTER ] | FULL [ OUTER ]
join_condition :: USING ( <column_name> [ , ... ] )
                | ON <predicate>

predicate :: <value> <binary_op> <value>
           | <value> [ NOT ] IN ( <query> )
           | [ NOT ] EXISTS ( <query> )

value :: <predicate>
       | <function> ( [ <arg> [ , ... ] ])
       | <query>
----

* Temporarily, column names in XTDB SQL must be qualified - e.g. `SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name FROM users u`
* Predicates and functions are taken from the XT 'standard library'.

[NOTE]
====
There is a table and column name mapping between SQL and XTQL: documents inserted with XTQL have their hyphens translated to underscores, and their namespace segments converted to `$` symbols, as hyphens, periods and slashes are not valid symbols in SQL identifiers.

For example, `:foo.bar/baz-quux` in XTQL is referenced in SQL as `foo$bar$baz_quux`.

The built-in XTDB columns `:xt/id`, `:xt/valid-from`, `:xt/valid-to` etc are referenced in SQL as `xt$id`, `xt$valid_from` and `xt$valid_to` respectively.

This mapping is reversed when querying SQL documents from XTQL.
